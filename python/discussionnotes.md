## Files Explained

The following .py Solution Files are answers made during in zoom discussion. 

The .py game is a silly discussion opener to show the Leetcode solutions in use in a full program. 

The study Folder includes any discussion photos or notes shared in the chat

How [::-1] works the same as [i for i in range(length,-1,-1)] and why the range must be [length, -1] instead of [length, 0]

Terse (or Minified solutions) vs expanded - which are better in practice for an interview
 the Big 0 of solutions

 Speed of solving the problem vs efficiency in an interview : we determined that it is better to solve quickly with less efficient solutions, and then if there is still time left - ask if the interviewer would like the better solution 
 
Readability is always more important than one line code, but if one line code is used at least head it with a comment explaining the logic.

Time management and how much someone should invest in Leetcode while maintaining a healthy life balance.

## Summary 

Leetcode is great, but the most important thing for job interview prep is to have a happy life filled with good family, friends, and of course pets!
