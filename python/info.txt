The following .py Solution Files are answers made during in zoom discussion. 

The .py game is a silly discussion opener to show the Leetcode solutions in use in a full program. 

The study Folder includes any discussion photos or notes shared in the chat

For this discussion we talked about:
>The extensive library of Python math operations and string functions
>Why Python is so great for interviews and logic problems, in general
>How [::-1] works the same as [i for i in range(length,-1,-1)] and why the range must be [length, -1] instead of [length, 0] 
>Terse (or Minified solutions) vs expanded - which are better in practice for an interview
> the Big 0 of solutions
>Two pointer solutions
> Speed of solving the problem vs efficiency in an interview : we determined that it is better to solve quickly with less efficient solutions, and then if there is still time left - ask if the interviewer would like the better solution 
>Readability is always more important than one line code, but if one line code is used at least head it with a comment explaining the logic
